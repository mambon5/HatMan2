        <div>What is a web socket: enables interaction webtween a web browser 
        and a web server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for
        the server to send content to the client without beig first requested by the client.
        This allows the messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open.
        Communications are usually done over TCP port number 443, which passes a non-web internet
        connection blockade by a firewall.</div>

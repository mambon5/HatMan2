        <div><b>What is a web socket</b>: enables interaction webtween a web browser 
        and a web server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for
        the server to send content to the client without beig first requested by the client.
        This allows the messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open.
        Communications are usually done over TCP port number 443, which passes a non-web internet
        connection blockade by a firewall.</div>
        <p><b>port</b>: wiki says: it is a communication endpoint. At software level it 
        identifies a specific process. It is identified by a 16 bit unsigned number (the 
        port number) A port is identifies for each transport protocol. <br>
        A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of
        transport protocol used for communication.
        <br> Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.
        <br><i>For this purpose, the lowest-numbered 1024 port numbers identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the well-known port numbers. Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as ephemeral ports. </i>
        
        </p>
        <p><b>transport protocol:</b> Most common ones are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
        the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</p>
